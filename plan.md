2.  **Product Creation in Shopify**:
    *   Create products in Shopify with high-quality images, descriptions, and prices.
    *   Organize products into collections (e.g., "Meats", "Handmade Goods", "Farm Fresh").
3.  **Inventory Management**:
    *   Set up inventory tracking for each product to manage stock levels.

## Phase 2: Storefront Design & Branding

1.  **Theme Selection**: Choose a Shopify theme that reflects the farm's rustic and homegrown brand identity. A theme with strong imagery support would be ideal.
2.  **Homepage Design**:
    *   Showcase featured products and collections.
    *   Tell the story of the farm, drawing from the "About Us" section of the current website.
    *   Include a section for newsletter signup to keep customers updated.
3.  **Page Creation**:
    *   **About Us**: A page detailing the story of Maggie and Kevin and their farm.
    *   **Products**: A page to browse all products and collections.
    *   **Contact Us**: A page with contact information, including the farm's address and a contact form.
    *   **Delivery Information**: A page explaining the delivery areas and schedule, based on the information for Delaware, Mayes, and Rogers Counties.
    *   **FAQ**: A page to answer common questions about products, farming practices, and delivery.

## Phase 3: Payments & Checkout

1.  **Payment Gateway Setup**: Configure Shopify Payments or another payment provider to accept credit card payments.
2.  **Checkout Customization**: Customize the checkout process to be simple and clear for customers.

## Phase 4: Shipping & Delivery

1.  **Local Delivery Zones**: Set up shipping zones for the specified delivery areas in Northeast Oklahoma (Delaware, Mayes, and Rogers Counties).
2.  **Delivery Rates**: Define delivery fees for these local zones. Consider offering free delivery over a certain order amount.
3.  **Pickup Option**: If applicable, set up a local pickup option for customers who wish to pick up their orders from the farm or a designated location like "The Saturday Market".

## Phase 5: Launch

1.  **Final Review**: Thoroughly review the entire store for any issues with product information, pricing, design, and checkout process.
2.  **Go Live**: Publish the store and announce the launch to customers.

## Phase 6: Marketing & Community Growth

1.  **Enhance Storytelling**:
    *   Expand the "About Us" page to highlight the unique aspects of the farm: the "wild" animals, the sustainable "nose-to-tail" philosophy, and the family-run nature of the business.
    *   Create a blog to share stories from the farm, announce new products, and connect with the community.
2.  **Promote On-Farm Experiences**:
    *   Create a "Visit the Farm" page with details about farm tours, events, and local pickup.
    *   Emphasize the unique experience of visiting a working homestead.
3.  **Local Community Engagement**:
    *   Prominently feature the local pickup option for customers in and around Strang, Oklahoma.
    *   Create special offers or bundles for local customers.
4.  **Product Strategy**:
    *   Create product bundles, such as a "Breakfast Box" (bacon, sausage, eggs) or a "Homestead Spa Basket" (soaps, etc.) to increase average order value.
    *   Continue to promote subscriptions for recurring revenue.
